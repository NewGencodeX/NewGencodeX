# Hi there 👋, I'm Godson

##  About Me

I’m a student developer with a deep curiosity for how data, systems, and intelligence come together to solve real‑world problems. I believe learning is best done by **building**, and I’m constantly pushing myself to grow—technically and personally.

I enjoy turning complex ideas into simple, practical solutions and I’m especially interested in projects that create **meaningful impact**, not just flashy code.
